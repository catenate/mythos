Sagan, C.  1980.  Cosmos.  Random house.

The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent
to the concerns of such puny creatures as we are.

The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding.
Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home.
In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty.
And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise.
In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and
unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it,
explorations that are exhilarating to consider.  They remind us that
humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy,
that knowledge is prerequisite to survival.  I believe our future depends
powerfully on how well we understand this Cosmos in which we float
like a mote of dust in the morning sky.
