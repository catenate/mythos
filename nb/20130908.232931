The Elder Futhark, used for writing Proto-Norse, consists of 24 runes
that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is
referred to as an Ætt.  The earliest known sequential listing of the
full set of 24 runes dates to approximately CE 400 and is found on the
Kylver Stone in Gotland, Sweden.

Most probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of
the rune itself.  The names are, however, not directly attested for
the Elder Futhark themselves.  Reconstructed names in Proto-Germanic
have been produced, based on the names given for the runes in the
later alphabets attested in the rune poems and the linked names of the
letters of the Gothic alphabet.  The letter æ was named from The Runic
letter called, Ansuz.  An asterisk before the rune names means that
they are unattested reconstructions.

The Futhark[edit source | editbeta]

The Elder Futhark (named after the initial phoneme of the first six rune names: F, U, Th, A, R and K) consist of twenty-four runes, often arranged in three groups of eight runes called an ætt.[2] In the following table, each rune is given with its common transliteration:

	 f	 u	 þ	 a	 r	 k	 g	 w
	 h	 n	 i	 j	 ï	 p	 z	 s
	 t	 b	 e	 m	 l	 ŋ	 d	 o

þ corresponds to [θ].  ï is also transliterated as æ, and may have
been either a diphthong, or a vowel near [ɪ] or [æ].  z was
Proto-Germanic [z], and evolved into Proto-Norse [ɹ], and is also
transliterated as R. The remaining transliterations correspond to the
IPA symbol of their approximate value.

The earliest known sequential listing of the alphabet dates to 400 and
is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland:

	[f]uþarkg[w]hnijpïzstbemlŋdo

Two instances of another early inscription were found on the two
Vadstena and Mariedamm bracteates (6th century), showing the division
in three ætts, with the positions of ï, p and o, d inverted compared
to the Kylver stone:
	fuþarkgw; hnijïpzs; tbemlŋod

The Grumpan bracteate presents a listing from 500 which is identical
to the one found on the previous bracteates but incomplete:

	fuþarkgw ... hnijïp(z) ... tbeml(ŋ)(o)d
