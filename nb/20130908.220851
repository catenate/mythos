spear

The spear was fashioned by the dwarfs known as the Sons of Ivaldi
under the mastery of the blacksmith dwarf Dvalin.  The spear was
obtained from the dwarfs by Loki, the result of a scheme he concocted
as a partial reparation for his cutting of the goddess Sif’s hair.
The spear is described as being so well balanced that it could strike
any target, no matter the skill or strength of the wielder.

runes carved on the tip of Gungnir

Wotan’s (Odin’s) spear is made from the wood of the world tree
Yggdrasil and engraved with the contracts from which Wotan’s power
derives.  When he tries to bar the eponymous hero of the opera,
Siegfried, from awakening Brünnhilde from her magic sleep, Siegfried
breaks the spear in two and Wotan flees.  It is implied that this is
also the end of Wotan’s power and he never appears onstage again.
